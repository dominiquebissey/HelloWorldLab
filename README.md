GitHub ReadMe HelloWorldLab-

The application Hello World opens the user to a screen stating "Hello World!" and prompts the user to type their name and then hit the "Click Me" button.
After the user types their name and clickc the "Click Me" button the screen then changes to state "Hi," followed by the user's name. In my case it states "Hi, Dominique Bissey".
